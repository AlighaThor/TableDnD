## Installation

The easiest way to install this is using:

`npm install tablednd`

or

`bower install https://github.com/isocra/TableDnD.git`

---

## NB This is work in progress, please do not install via NPM *YET*

---

This will install the TableDnD plugin into your bower components as well as installing [jQuery](http://jquery.com) which it depends on.

Documentation can be found at [TableDnD](http://isocra.github.io/TableDnD/).

You can also play and experiment with TableDnD using this [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/DenisHo/dxpLrcd9/embedded/result/) (it's not complete yet, the ajax callbacks don't work--not surprisingly--but it's still useful for testing and exploring).
